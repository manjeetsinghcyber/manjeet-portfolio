    <h3>Cybersecurity Student | Future Security Analyst</h3>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a cybersecurity and information security student with strong hands-on experience in networking, Linux, 
            firewalls, log analysis, and security tools. I study Computer & Information Technology with an Information Security 
            focus at Purdue University Indianapolis. I also completed an Associate degree in Software Development from Ivy Tech.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have over four years of experience at Amazon, working up to a Level 3 TOM associate. I manage yard operations, 
            support drivers, follow safety rules, and help train new hires. Working in fast-paced environments has made me calm 
            under pressure and a good problem solver.
        </p>

        <p>
            In school, I completed labs and projects including pfSense firewall setup, LAMP server setup, WordPress hardening, 
            Linux server admin, network tools, log analysis, and cybersecurity exercises such as steganography, hashing, and 
            MITRE ATT&CK work. My goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst and keep learning every day.
        </p>
