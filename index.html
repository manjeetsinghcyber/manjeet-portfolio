    <h1>Manjeet Singh</h1>
    <h3>Cybersecurity Student | Future Security Analyst</h3>

    <p>
        I am a cybersecurity and information security student with strong hands-on experience in networking, Linux, firewalls, log analysis, and security tools. I study Computer & Information Technology with an Information Security focus at Purdue University Indianapolis. I have also completed an Associate degree in Software Development from Ivy Tech, which gave me experience in programming and understanding how systems work.
I have more than four years of work experience at Amazon, where I started as a warehouse associate and worked my way up to a Level 3 TOM (Transportation Operations Management) associate. In this role, I manage yard operations, follow safety rules, support drivers, and help train new hires. Working in fast-moving environments has made me very responsible, calm under pressure, and good at solving problems.
In school, I completed many labs and projects including pfSense firewall configuration, LAMP server setup, WordPress hardening, Linux server administration, network tools (ping, traceroute, nslookup, whois), log analysis, and cybersecurity assignments such as steganography, hashing, encryption, and MITRE ATT&CK scenarios. I also work with Python and SQL, and I enjoy learning about ethical hacking and real security tools.
I am building this public portfolio to show my skills, projects, and growth as I work toward becoming a cybersecurity analyst. My goal is to work in blue team security, SOC analysis, or penetration testing in the future. I am always learning, improving, and staying updated with the latest cybersecurity techniques.
